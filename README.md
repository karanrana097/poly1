## File Descriptions
- `approveDeposit.js`: Approves deposits on the blockchain.
- `batchMint.js`: Handles batch minting of NFTs.
- `deploy.js`: Used for deploying smart contracts.
- `FxRootContractAbi.js`: Contains the ABI for the FxRootContract.
- `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration file for the Hardhat development environment.
- `nfts.js`: Manages NFT interactions.
- `Wolverine.sol`: A Solidity smart contract for NFT functionality.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or Yarn
- Ethereum wallet with ETH
- Hardhat

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Set up environment variables (e.g., private keys, network URLs).

## Usage
